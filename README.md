# daily_planner_module5

## Description
This project contains the 5th homework which is to create a a daily planner. In this homework I, from the source code provided, 
created a daily planner that uses the dayjs api to get date information and incorporate its functionality to design the planner, while saving
user inputs in local storage so that they persist through page refreshes. When the date rolls over and the page is refreshed the schedule 
will clear so another day of planning can begin
